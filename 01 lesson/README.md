- We use reactJS to create websites(UI's).
- ReactJS uses: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. (NodejS).

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces based on UI components.

- It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.
- React can be used as a base in the development of SPA(single-page-apps) or mobile applications
- Latest version: v17.0.2

### React vs React-native

##### react.js

- A js library for building UI's
- React usually is used with web development.
- React.Dom.Render(...) : adds the web support. We can instead render data to anywhere else.

##### react native

- A collection of special react components. (View, Text)
- components are compiled to native widgets.
- Gives access to native platform API's exposed to JS. (camera, location etc..).

### How does reactJS work?

React will create virtual DOM in memory.

- It allows us to change only the necessary elements. (not all the page).
- react only changes what needs to be changed.
